Pastry-Algorithm
================

This project deals with implementing the Join, Route and Delete APIs of the PASTRY algorithm (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/antr/PAST/pastry.pdf). A P2P (decentralized) network is implemented with AKKA actors where each actor behaves as a peer. The time taken for each operation is tested to be logarithmic in the number of nodes.
